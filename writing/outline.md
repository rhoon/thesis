##Introduction:
  1. Thesis statement
  2. An introduction to the role of the algorithm in judging influence
  3. and network analyses as a mode of visualizing knowledge

##Dada (brief overview) Foster (1996)
  1. Impact on art. (Duchamp)
  2. Impact on design. (Proto-modernism)
  3. Impact on music. (Mechanical music etc)
  4. Politics.

##Data source, structure, and methodology and visualization.

**A. Network analyses mapping knowledge and/or influence**
  1. Historic Knowledge Trees - The book of trees : visualizing branches of knowledge
  2. Visual Networks - Visual complexity mapping patterns of information
  3. Dietmar Offenhuber’s Semaspace - http://residence.aec.at/didi/FLweb/
  4. Chris Harrison’s ClusterBall, mapping wikipedia’s structure around broad topics http://www.chrisharrison.net/index.php/Visualizations/ClusterBall
  5. NYT Labs Cascade - http://nytlabs.com/projects/cascade.html

**B. Wikipedia.**
  1. Availability and breadth. Kittur et al (2009), Mesgari et al (2014)
  2. Comprensive-ness West and Williamson (2009),
  3. Accuracy Rosenzweig, R. (2006)
  4. Weaker Points - gender representation Reagle and Rhue (2011), categorical bias Halavais and Lackaff (2008)

**C. Network Analysis Methodology**
  1. ‘proximity’ of topic - how many ‘links’ away & ‘strength’ of influence - how many links within proximity point at it; inward vs. outward pointing links (similar to PageRank : U.S. Patent 6,285,999 and citation analysis; more sources forthcoming)
  2. geography (places mentioned) & era (years mentioned)
  3. Technology used (NLP, any others)
  4. Network analyses (transition to)

##Meta-analysis of data, comparison to historical sources, conclusion
  1. Weak points vs. historic sources (outside of narrative structure)
  2. What it reveals not potentially seen in historical sources.
  3. Where it can go from here.
  4. Conclusion.

##Broad Notes

**Audience:**
- Content: Art historians, cultural historians, Dada enthusiasts, Wikipedians
- Model: Sociologists, History of Ideas, Philosophers
- Visualization: Data-visualization enthusiasts (hopefully!), design/art enthusiasts

**How much can I expect them to know already:**
- Perhaps loose context for most, although some will be experts

**Response: Contradiction? Arguments?**
- Data source (wikipedia) -> Bias (under-represented populations); Comprehensiveness; Accuracy;
- Data collection -> Only collecting ‘linked’ items?, accuracy of technology (NLP),
- Metric of ‘Influence’
- Quantitative approach to qualitative topic
- Under-reliant on the creations of art/musicians/poets of Dada to tell the story of Dada - could be too ‘meta’

**Source notes:**<br />
**Primary source: Wikipedia**<br />
**Secondary sources fall into four categories:**<br />
1. Art history (Dada)
2. Network Analyses/Quantifying influence (citation / pageRank)
3. Accuracy of Wikipedia
4. Network Visualization (similar visualizations, knowledge trees)
